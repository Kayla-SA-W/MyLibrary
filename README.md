## Planning Story

This project is inspired by my google sheets doc of all of the books I have read over the last three years.
I wanted a place that I created to store those books as well as my thoughts and opinions of them.
I started out by creating wireframes for the different parts of the SPA that I thought were important.
After creating my wireframes I thought about the different kinds of relationships I wanted to have for my project.
I have started with a one to many relationship (one user to many books) but hope to complete a more complicated ERD.
I created a database similar to the one that I have on google docs that a collection of books.
Once my database was set up I began to work on the front end where I allowed the user to send different reuqests to the api.
Users can create, update, and delete their own books as well as see all of the books currently in their library.
